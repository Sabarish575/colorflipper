# colorflipper
This project creates a simple webpage that allows users to change the background color by clicking a button. The background color changes to a random color from a predefined list each time the button is clicked.
The webpage also displays the selected color code in the heading and remembers the previously chosen colors using localStorage.

## How to Use
-> Save the HTML file (index.html) and the CSS file (output.css) in the same directory.
-> Open the HTML file in a web browser.
-> Click the button to change the background color.

## Technologies Used
 HTML
 CSS
JavaScript

## Additional Information
You can customize the predefined colors in the JavaScript code (const color = [...]).
This is a basic example and can be extended to include more features, such as additional color options or animations.
